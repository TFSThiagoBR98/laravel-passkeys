Currently, the package doesn't provide dedicated components for Inertia-based apps. However, you can still use the package's features in your Inertia applications by creating your own components that utilize the package's action classes.

If you're using Inertia with either Vue or React, you can contribute to [this package PRing additional docs or components](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-passkeys/pulls).
