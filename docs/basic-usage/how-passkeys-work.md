Passkeys let you log in without needing a password. Instead of a password, you can generate a passkey which will be stored in 1Pass, MacOS' password app, or alternative app on your favourite OS.

Here's how it looks like when creating a passkey on [Mailcoach](https://mailcoach.app), which uses spatie/laravel-passkeys under the hood.

And here's what logging in on Mailcoach using a passkeys looks like. Note that your don't have to type in your email address or password. You just need to click the "Log in with passkey" and let 1Pass (or alternative app) do the rest.

## Under the hood

A passkey is a unique key pair generated by a password manager or hardware security key. One key is public and stored on in your Laravel app, and the other is private and stored in the password manager.

When logging using a passkey, your Laravel app will generate a challenge that your password manager can solve using the stored private key. The password manager will create a secure response and send it back to Laravel app. If the challenge is solved correctly, you will be logged in.
